      <description>Meta-learners for treatment effect estimation &amp;amp; optimal treatment recommendation under multiple treatment setting Meta-learners are a simple way to leverage off-the-shelf predictive machine learning methods to estimate CATE/HTE/ITE.
Treatment Effect Estimation Q-learning gets its name because its objective function plays a role similar to that of the Q or reward function in reinforcement learnin (Li, Wang, and Tu 2021) and is first used in estimating optimal dynamic treatment regime (Murphy 2003; Robins 2004; Schulte et al.</description>

      <title>Review of Causal Inference: An Overview</title>

      <description>Brief Introduction The need for causal inference arises in many different fields. Economists want to quantify the causal effects of interest rate cut on the economy. Trade policy makers want to know whether increased tariff causes changes in trade deficit. Healthcare providers want to assess whether a therapy causes changes in specific patient outcomes. Conceptually, causal inference is all about a question of ‘what if’. People can ask themself what if I took chemotherapy rather than radiation to treat my cancer, would I get better now?</description>

      <description>Notice: the causal inference described here follows the idea of Potential Outcome Framework (Neyman 1923; Rubin 1974). For another big camp of causal inference studies, i.e., Structural Causal Model (SCM) (Pearl 2009), please refer to this well-written paper here.
