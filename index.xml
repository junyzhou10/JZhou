      <description>Junyi Zhou is currently a Ph.D. candidate in Biostatistics at Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health and School of Medicine, Indiana University. He is co-advised by Dr. Wanzhu Tu and Dr. Ying Zhang. His research focuses on data clustering methods especially for longitudinal data; causal inference in potential outcome framework when multiple treatments exist; positive and unlabeled data learning methods in the situation like cancer-metastasis that only positive cases are for sure, while the rest are unlabeled.</description>

      <title>Positive-and-Unlabeled Learning</title>

      <description>Introduction Positive and unlabeled learning, or positive-unlabeled (PU) learning, refers to the binary classification problem where only positive labels are observed and the rest are unlabeled. Since unlabeled part of data consists of both positive and negative instances, naively treating them as negative and performing a standard classification learning algorithm will underestimate the probability of being positive (Ward et al. 2009; Yang et al. 2012). Without providing negative instances in the training set, however, will prevent the direct use of well-developed supervised classification methods.</description>

      <title>Connection between the Idea behind OptTrialDesign &amp; CAPM in Finance</title>
      <link>https://jzhou.org/posts/odt-capm/</link>

      <description>Idea behind OptTrialDesign In Optimal Design Strategy, we propose a novel way to find the optimal trial design, in terms of maximizing the financial outcomes, i.e., Expected Net Revenue (ENR), but also under the regulatory requirements. We have to trade-off because in pharmaceutical companies’ position, a shorter study/trial duration leads to earlier market access which helps to maximize the profits before LOE (loss of exclusivity). On the other hand, regulatory agencies and health technology assessment (HTA) bodies wish to see more guaranteed clinical results, which usually require longer study duration.</description>

      <title>Review of Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://jzhou.org/posts/proposal/</link>

      <description>Notice: the causal inference described here follows the idea of Potential Outcome Framework (Neyman 1923; Rubin 1974). For another big camp of causal inference studies, i.e., Structural Causal Model (SCM) (Neuberg 2003), please refer to this well-written paper here.
Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation 1. Introduction The need for causal inference arises in many different fields. Economists want to quantify the causal effects of interest rate cut on the economy.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Optimization</title>

      <description>Optimization is the key component of the AI/ML algorithm. Whatever objective function is proposed, the final step is to optimize it. Convex optimization problems, either unconstrained or constrained, are well explored (see here). Even though, the efficiency or performance still largely depends on the shape of the surface of the objective function. For convex problems, the solution could be trapped at saddle points; or for local convex objective functions, the solution might reach to the local optima instead of global optima.</description>
