@article{Chamroukhi2018CC,
	abstract = {Complex data analysis is a central topic of modern statistics and learning systems which is becoming of broader interest with the increasing prevalence of high-dimensional data. The challenge is to develop statistical models and autonomous algorithms that are able to discern knowledge from raw data, which can be achieved through clustering techniques, or to make predictions of future data via classification techniques. Latent data models, including mixture model-based approaches, are among the most popular and successful approaches in both supervised and unsupervised learning. Although being traditional tools in multivariate analysis, they are growing in popularity when considered in the framework of functional data analysis (FDA). FDA is the data analysis paradigm in which each datum is a function, rather than a real vector. In many areas of application, including signal and image processing, functional imaging, bioinformatics, etc., the analyzed data are indeed often available in the form of discretized values of functions, curves, or surfaces. This functional aspect of the data adds additional difficulties when compared to classical multivariate data analysis. We review and present approaches for model-based clustering and classification of functional data. We present well-grounded statistical models along with efficient algorithmic tools to address problems regarding the clustering and the classification of these functional data, including their heterogeneity, missing information, and dynamical hidden structures. The presented models and algorithms are illustrated via real-world functional data analysis problems from several areas of application. This article is categorized under: Fundamental Concepts of Data and Knowledge > Data Concepts Algorithmic Development > Statistics Technologies > Structure Discovery and Clustering},

	abstract = {Clustering is a useful tool for finding structure in a data set. The mixture likelihood approach to clustering is a popular clustering method, in which the EM algorithm is the most used method. However, the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixture models is quite sensitive to initial values and the number of its components needs to be given a priori. To resolve these drawbacks of the EM, we develop a robust EM clustering algorithm for Gaussian mixture models, first creating a new way to solve these initialization problems. We then construct a schema to automatically obtain an optimal number of clusters. Therefore, the proposed robust EM algorithm is robust to initialization and also different cluster volumes with automatically obtaining an optimal number of clusters. Some experimental examples are used to compare our robust EM algorithm with existing clustering methods. The results demonstrate the superiority and usefulness of our proposed method.},

	abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

Given n sets, this procedure permits their reduction to n - 1 mutually exclusive sets by considering the union of all possible n(n - 1)/2 pairs and selecting a union having a maximal value for the functional relation, or objective function, that reflects the criterion chosen by the investigator. By repeating this process until only one group remains, the complete hierarchical structure and a quantitative estimate of the loss associated with each stage in the grouping can be obtained.

We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.},

@article{NieQuasi2020,
	abstract = {{Flexible estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects lies at the heart of many statistical applications, such as personalized medicine and optimal resource allocation. In this article we develop a general class of two-step algorithms for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in observational studies. First, we estimate marginal effects and treatment propensities to form an objective function that isolates the causal component of the signal. Then, we optimize this data-adaptive objective function. The proposed approach has several advantages over existing methods. From a practical perspective, our method is flexible and easy to use: in both steps, any loss-minimization method can be employed, such as penalized regression, deep neural networks, or boosting; moreover, these methods can be fine-tuned by cross-validation. Meanwhile, in the case of penalized kernel regression, we show that our method has a quasi-oracle property. Even when the pilot estimates for marginal effects and treatment propensities are not particularly accurate, we achieve the same error bounds as an oracle with prior knowledge of these two nuisance components. We implement variants of our approach based on penalized regression, kernel ridge regression, and boosting in a variety of simulation set-ups, and observe promising performance relative to existing baselines.}},

@article{robinson1988root,
	abstract = {One type of semiparametric regression on an $\scr{R}^{p}\times \scr{R}^{q}\text{-valued}$ random variable (X, Z) is β′X + θ(Z), where β and θ(Z) are an unknown slope coefficient vector and function, and X is neither wholly dependent on Z nor necessarily independent of it. Estimators of β based on incorrect parameterization of θ are generally inconsistent, whereas consistent nonparametric estimators deviate from β by a larger probability order than N-1/2, where N is sample size. An estimator generalizing the ordinary least squares estimator of β is constructed by inserting nonparametric regression estimators in the nonlinear orthogonal projection on Z. Under regularity conditions β̂ is shown to be $N^{1/2}\text{-consistent}$ for β and asymptotically normal, and a consistent estimator of its limiting covariance matrix is given, affording statistical inference that is not only asymptotically valid but has nonzero asymptotic first-order efficiency relative to estimators based on a correctly parameterized θ. We discuss the identification problem and β̂'s efficiency, and report results of a Monte Carlo study of finite-sample performance. While the paper focuses on the simplest interesting setting of multiple regression with independent observations, extensions to other econometric models are described, in particular seemingly unrelated and nonlinear regressions, simultaneous equations, distributed lags, and sample selectivity models.},

@article{Chernozhukov2018,
	abstract = {{We revisit the classic semi‐parametric problem of inference on a low‐dimensional parameter θ0 in the presence of high‐dimensional nuisance parameters η0. We depart from the classical setting by allowing for η0 to be so high‐dimensional that the traditional assumptions (e.g. Donsker properties) that limit complexity of the parameter space for this object break down. To estimate η0, we consider the use of statistical or machine learning (ML) methods, which are particularly well suited to estimation in modern, very high‐dimensional cases. ML methods perform well by employing regularization to reduce variance and trading off regularization bias with overfitting in practice. However, both regularization bias and overfitting in estimating η0 cause a heavy bias in estimators of θ0 that are obtained by naively plugging ML estimators of η0 into estimating equations for θ0. This bias results in the naive estimator failing to be N−1/2 consistent, where N is the sample size. We show that the impact of regularization bias and overfitting on estimation of the parameter of interest θ0 can be removed by using two simple, yet critical, ingredients: (1) using Neyman‐orthogonal moments/scores that have reduced sensitivity with respect to nuisance parameters to estimate θ0; (2) making use of cross‐fitting, which provides an efficient form of data‐splitting. We call the resulting set of methods double or debiased ML (DML). We verify that DML delivers point estimators that concentrate in an N−1/2‐neighbourhood of the true parameter values and are approximately unbiased and normally distributed, which allows construction of valid confidence statements. The generic statistical theory of DML is elementary and simultaneously relies on only weak theoretical requirements, which will admit the use of a broad array of modern ML methods for estimating the nuisance parameters, such as random forests, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, and various hybrids and ensembles of these methods. We illustrate the general theory by applying it to provide theoretical properties of the following: DML applied to learn the main regression parameter in a partially linear regression model; DML applied to learn the coefficient on an endogenous variable in a partially linear instrumental variables model; DML applied to learn the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect on the treated under unconfoundedness; DML applied to learn the local average treatment effect in an instrumental variables setting. In addition to these theoretical applications, we also illustrate the use of DML in three empirical examples.}},
