      <description>Chapter 3. Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation 3.1 Introduction The need for causal inference arises in many different fields. Economists want to quantify the causal effects of interest rate cut on the economy. Trade policy makers want to know whether increased tariff causes changes in trade deficit. Healthcare providers want to assess whether a therapy causes changes in specific patient outcomes. In this proposal, I examine the estimation of causal effects therapeutic treatments by using observational data in a population where the treatment effects vary by observed patient characteristics.</description>

      <description>Optimization is the key component of the AI/ML algorithm. Whatever objective function is proposed, the final step is to optimize it. Convex optimization problems, either unconstrained or constrained, are well explored (see here). Even though, the efficiency or performance still largely depends on the shape of the surface of the objective function. For convex problems, the solution could be trapped at saddle points; or for local convex objective functions, the solution might reach to the local optima instead of global optima.</description>
